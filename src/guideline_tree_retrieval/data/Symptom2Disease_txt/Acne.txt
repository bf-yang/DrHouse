- Significant psychological distress

Mild acne vulgaris may be considered acne presenting with small, comedonal or papulopustular lesions without associated scarring. Skin involvement is typically limited to 1 body area or is associated with relatively few lesions in more than 1 body area. Nodules and near confluent skin involvement are absent. The response to acne therapies typically can be assessed after 3 months of treatment.
