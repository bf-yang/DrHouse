Cervical spondylosis. Sagittal (A), parasagittal (B) and axial images from a CT of the cervical spine. The sagittal image (A) demonstrates loss of disc space height, endplate osteophyte formation, endplate sclerosis and subcortical cystic change at multiple levels in the cervical spine (arrows). At C4-C5 there is near complete fusion across the disc space (dashed arrows). On the parasagittal image (B) severe facet joint degenerative changes are seen including loss of joint space, subcortical cystic change, sclerosis, and hypertrophic bone resulting in near fusion of the facet joints (thick arrows) in the upper cervical spine. In this patient, the facet degenerative changes were much greater on the right than the left, as seen in the axial image (C) at the C2-C3 level, with hypertrophy and sclerosis of the bony facet joint (arrowhead) on the right.
