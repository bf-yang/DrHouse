Empiric antimicrobial selection for acute complicated urinary tract infection in adults in the outpatient setting

The diagnosis of acute complicated UTI can be made in the following clinical scenarios:

Cystitis symptoms and pyuria with either:
Temperature >99.9°F (37.7°C)
or
Signs/symptoms of systemic illness (eg, chills, rigors, acute onset of fatigue or malaise)*
Flank pain and/or costovertebral angle tenderness with pyuria
Fever or sepsis in the setting of pyuria, without other evident cause of infection
Obtain:

Urine culture and susceptibility testing
↓

Are there any risk factors for an MDR infection? These include a history of any of the following in the prior 3 months:

An MDR urinary isolate (ie, non-susceptible to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes; this includes an ESBL-producing isolate) or a fluoroquinolone-resistant Pseudomonas urinary isolate
Inpatient stay at health care facility (eg, hospital, nursing home, or long-term acute care facility)
Use of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial (eg, fluoroquinolone, TMP-SMX, 3rd or later generation cephalosporin)[1]
Travel to parts of the world with high rates of MDR organisms (including India, Israel, Spain, Mexico)
↓

Are there any of the following?

Contraindication to fluoroquinolone:
Allergy or intolerance to a fluoroquinolone
Unmodifiable drug interactions
High risk for fluoroquinolone resistance, specifically:
History of fluoroquinolone-resistant urinary isolate within the prior three months
History of fluoroquinolone use in prior three months
↓

Yes

No

↓

Are there any contraindications to or concerns with fluoroquinolones?
These include:

Allergy or intolerance to a fluoroquinolone
Unmodifiable drug interactions
