The image contains a flowchart titled "Treatment algorithm for nail psoriasis." It outlines a step-by-step approach for treating nail psoriasis based on the severity of the disease. Here is a textual description of the flowchart:

Mild nail disease*:

First-line treatments:
Topical calcipotriol with high-potency topical corticosteroid
High-potency topical corticosteroid
Topical calcipotriol
If first-line treatments are ineffective, second-line treatments are recommended:
Topical tacrolimus
Topical tazarotene
If the condition is refractory to topical therapy, consider therapies for moderate to severe disease.
Moderate to severe nail disease¶:

Biologic treatments are suggested, which include TNF-alpha inhibitor, ustekinumab, secukinumab, or ixekizumab.
If biologics are not feasible or desired, alternative treatments are considered:
Methotrexate
Apremilast
Intralesional corticosteroid injections
Tazarotene or other topical therapies
Pulsed dye laser
The diagram also contains two footnotes:

TNF: tumor necrosis factor.
Nail psoriasis limited to 1 or 2 nails and without significant symptoms or functional impairment.
¶ Nail psoriasis associated with marked nail dystrophy involving more than 2 nails or nail psoriasis associated with significant symptoms or functional impairment.
The flowchart visually splits the treatment paths between mild nail psoriasis and moderate to severe nail psoriasis, with further subdivisions based on treatment responses and patient-specific considerations.
