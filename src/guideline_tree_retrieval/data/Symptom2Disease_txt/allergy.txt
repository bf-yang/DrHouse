*A penicillin allergy history includes the following:
- Each agent reportedly associated with a reaction and the indication for its use (to make sure that the agent matches the indication).
- The exact signs and symptoms that occurred, in as much detail as the patient and/or medical record can provide.
- When the reaction occurred (ie, how long ago) and at what point in therapy (immediately after starting or later in course).
- The dose and route of medication taken (if known).
- Other concurrent medications, especially if they were new or temporary.
- Any treatment given and response to that treatment (including the duration of reaction).

¶Allergy can be excluded based upon history if:
- Reaction was not allergic (eg, isolated nausea or diarrhea, yeast vaginitis, other predictable adverse effect of drug) or
- Patient never took a penicillin but has family members with penicillin allergy.
