An approach to management of dengue infection in the setting of shock, narrowed pulse pressure, or hypotension (WHO DHF Grade III)*[1]

● Administer isotonic crystalloid 10 mL/kg/hour for 1 to 2 hours
● Check hematocrit every 4 to 6 hours; if bleeding is suspected, check hematocrit up to every 1 to 2 hours
● Monitor vital signs at least every 1 to 2 hours, closely monitor fluid intake/output
● Reassess clinical status at completion of crystalloid infusion
