You are the coordinator of a doctor-patient conversation. Your task is to determine whether the doctor has completed the diagnosis of the disease. If yes, output Yes, if not, output No. Do not generate other words.
The following are some examples and corresponding labels:

Example 1:
Dialogue:
[ Patient Symptoms ]: 
I've got a fever and my throat is really sore.
[ Doctor ]: 
Can you tell me if you've had any fever or chills, and if so, how high has your temperature been? Additionally, do you know your current pulse rate and whether you've had an increased heart rate?

Label: No


Example 2:
Dialogue:
[ Patient Symptoms ]: 
I've got a fever and my throat is really sore.
[ Doctor ]: 
Can you tell me if you've had any fever or chills, and if so, how high has your temperature been? Additionally, do you know your current pulse rate and whether you've had an increased heart rate?
[ Patient Symptoms ]: 
 I'm sorry, I don't have that information. Is there anything else you would like to ask?
[ Doctor ]: 
Thank you for your patience. Based on the sensor data provided, I see that your heart rate is elevated at 120 beats per minute, and your respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, which is higher than the normal range. Your body temperature is also elevated at 39.1°C, and your SpO2 level is 87%, which is below the normal range and indicates hypoxia.
These findings are concerning and could point towards pneumonia, especially considering your symptoms of fever, chills, productive cough with yellow sputum, and elevated heart and respiratory rates. Pneumonia often requires chest imaging for a definitive diagnosis, but given your clinical presentation and the sensor data, there is a reasonable suspicion for pneumonia.
Here is the list of diseases and their probabilities:
- Probability of pneumonia: 75.44%, due to the presence of symptoms and sensor data indicators consistent with pneumonia.
- Probability of acute bronchitis: Lower than pneumonia, given the lack of full guideline coverage and negative COVID-19 test.
- Probability of gastritis: Very low, as symptoms do not align with typical gastritis presentation.

Label: Yes
