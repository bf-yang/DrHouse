Guideline approaches to initial asthma therapy in adults:
Step1:
Asthma symptoms:
Infrequent asthma symptoms (eg, <2 times/week)
No risk factors for exacerbations
Therapy:
Low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed (preferred) or Low-dose ICS whenever SABA used or as-needed low-dose ICS-SABA

Step2:
Asthma symptoms:
Asthma symptoms or need for reliever inhaler ≥2 times/week, but without troublesome daily symptoms
Therapy:
Low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed (preferred) or Low-dose ICS daily and SABA as needed. Other options: Low-dose ICS-SABA or ICS plus SABA, concomitantly administered, as needed or (less preferred). LTRA daily and SABA as needed.

Step3:
Asthma symptoms:
Troublesome asthma symptoms most days, nocturnal awakening due to asthma ≥1 time/month, multiple risk factors for exacerbations.
Therapy:
Low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy (preferred) or Low-dose ICS-LABA combination daily and SABA as needed. Other options:  Medium-dose ICS daily and SABA or ICS-SABA as needed or Low-dose ICS plus LTRA daily and SABA or ICS-SABA as needed.

Step4:
Asthma symptoms:
Severely uncontrolled asthma with ≥3 of thefollowing:
Daytime asthma symptoms >2 times/week
Nocturnal awakening due to asthma
Reliever needed for symptoms >2 times/week
Activity limitation due to asthma

Therapy:
Medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy (preferred) or Medium dose ICS-LABA daily
and SABA or ICS-SABA as needed. Other options: Possible add-on LAMA or switch to ICS-LAMA-LABA. Possible add-on LTRA.

Note: ICS: inhaled corticosteroid (glucocorticoid). LABA: long-acting beta-agonist; LAMA: long-actingmuscarinic antagonist; LTRA: leukotriene receptor antagonist; MDI: metered-dose inhaler; SABA: short-acting beta-agonist.
