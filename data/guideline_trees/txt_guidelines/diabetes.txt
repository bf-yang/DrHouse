	- History of PCOS
	- Physical inactivity
	- Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (eg, severe obesity acanthosisnigricans)
2. Patients with prediabetes (A1C ≥5.7% [39 mmol/mol], IGT, or IFG) should be tested yearly.
3. Patients with a history of GDM should have lifelong testing at least every 3 years.
4. For all other patients, testing should begin at age 35 years.
