Step3:
if:

	action:
	Evaluate for other causes based on clinical suspicion
elif: 
	Step4:
	concern for pneumonia based on any of the following?
	temperature > 38 
	Pulse > 100 bpm
	Respiratory rate > 22 bpm
	Hypoxia (oxygen saturation < 95%)
	if yes:
		action:
		obtain a chest radiograph to assess for pneumonia. 
		pursue additional testing based on the results, severity of illness, and whether a specific pathogen is suspected.
	elif:
		Step5:
