Lower extremity chronic venous disorders encompass an entire spectrum of morphologic and functional abnormalities of the venous system.

Symptoms and signs — Symptoms or findings include pain, leg heaviness, aching, swelling, skin dryness, tightness, itching, irritation, and muscle cramps. The clinical evaluation of the patient with lower extremity chronic venous disease is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Venous claudication, which is a severe deep pain and tightness typically in the thigh muscles with vigorous exercise, can occur in the setting of acute, severe venous obstruction or longstanding venous obstruction.

Visible clinical signs of chronic venous disorders in increasing severity include dilated veins (eg, telangiectasia, varicose veins), leg edema, skin changes, and skin ulceration. The prevalence of symptoms and clinical signs of venous disease correlates with the presence of venous reflux (superficial, deep venous obstruction) identified on duplex ultrasound.
