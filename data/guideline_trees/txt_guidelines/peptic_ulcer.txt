Patients with penetrating ulcers often present with a change in symptoms due to symptomatic involvement of adjacent structures:
- Gastrocolic or duodenocolic fistulas can present with halitosis, feculent vomiting,postprandial diarrhea, dyspepsia, and weight loss.
- Penetration into a surrounding organ can result in an abscess.
- Penetration into vascular structures can result in exsanguinating hemorrhage (eg, aortoenteric fistula or penetration into the cystic artery).
- Penetration into the biliary tree can result in a choledochoduodenal fistula, extrahepatic biliary obstruction, or hemobilia.
- Fistulization into the pancreatic duct has also been reported with penetrating duodenalulcers.
- Mild hyperamylasemia can develop with posterior penetration of either agastric or duodenal ulcer, but clinical pancreatitis is uncommon.
